What GG memory is saved during a gg update is controlled by a .cfg file.

CFG file properties
	1. .cfg files are simple text files.
	2. They must use the Windows line endings.
	3. They contain a list of commands documented below.
	4. Blank lines are ignored provided they have nothing in them, including any white space

CFG Commands
	1. "Commands" are always a single ASCII character.
	2. The command is always the first character in the line.
	3. White space is ignored.
	4. Commands are case sensitive.
	5. Any non numeric digits after the last parameter are ignored

Supported commands
	1.	'#' Comment. Everything after the '#' is ignored.

	2.	'P' Preserve. Indicates a range of bytes to preserve.
		Folllowed by two decimal numbers seperated by a comma.
		The first number is the offset from the base memory address
		and the second is the number of bytes to preserve starting at that address.
		The offset must be less than 2048 and the total of bytes saved in the whole
		file must be below 2000

		Example, save 32 bytes starting at offset 42:  P 42,32

	3. 'T' Totals, Check the total bytes saved as a check for file integrity.
		Folllowed by two decimal numbers seperated by a comma.
		The first number is the number of memory "chunks" being preserved
		and the second is the total number of bytes to preserve.
		Any 'P' commands after this cause an error.

		Example, 17 memory chunks totaoling 42 bytes in file:  T 17,42
