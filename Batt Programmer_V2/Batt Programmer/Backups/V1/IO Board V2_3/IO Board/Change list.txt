Changes for 4/27/20
1. Added description for 3.3V regulator

2. Updated version to 2.3.


Changes for 4/8/20 part deux
1. Corrected relay part numbers on schematic.

2. Added note on relay contact ratings.

3. Updated version to 2.2.


Changes for 4/8/20
1. Flipped diodes connected to relay coils

2. Reconnect +5 and Gnd to U2 which were disconnected when part was moved.

3. Updated version to 2.1


Changes for 3/18/20
1. Forget to note the addition of 3.3V voltage referance at U8.

2. Forgot to note the addition of R17 and R22. Used to divide the battery voltage to a level under the above referance voltage.

3. Removed R2, (Pull down on Batt+) not needed because of above change.

4. Rearanged the connections to K1 to simplify board routing.


Changes from V1 3/12/20
1. Relays K1, K2, K3 were added to isolate the unit from the outside connections until the unit was powered up and ready to go.
	a. This eliminates the need to remove a connected battery from the device to allow it to finsh powering up, which is currently the case.
	b. This also allows the device to do an extensive self test on power up.

2. Added load resistors R3, R12, and connected the clock and data signals to analog inputs to allow for self testing.
	a. The self test can verify the function of the pullup voltage select mux
	b. The test can also check the function of the pullup resistor selection and the resistor values
	c. This also eliminates the need for a seperate test box to check new units.

3. An extra relay with it's contacts brought out to additional terminals was added for future expansion.
	a. This could be used for switching a load or charger on/off as part of an automated test
	b. It could also be used to trigger a scope/data logger as part of a test.

4. A 100K pulldown was added on Batt+
	a. This was done as a rework on V1
	b. Needed to prevent detecting a battery due to voltage float on the line with nothing connected.
